# When a barcode scanner connects to your iPad running Shopify POS, it essentially becomes part of your payment processing chain. Anyone who modifies this hardware could potentially:

1) Install hidden firmware that skims transaction data
2) Create backdoors that allow remote access to your system
3) Implement keystroke logging to capture passwords or other sensitive information
4) Add components that could intercept customer payment data

If you decide to modify the hardware yourself, here are things oyu can do:
1) Antenna Modification for Better Bluetooth or replace the Bluetooth module (easiest)
2) USB direct connection (hardest and damage the scanner if you aren't expereince, so here's the instructions)

# Instructions 
1) Locate the main circuit board
2) Find the power input connections
3) Find data transmission points
4) Bypass wireless components( Bluetooth module) by connecting to USB data line 
- For USB: Connect to + and - lines in the USB cable
- For Lightning: I have no idea, but it's harder as they use some protocol

# Power connection:
1) Connect the USB/Lightning cable's power linesto the scanner's power input
2) You may need a voltage regulator if the scanner expects a different voltage than USB provides (5V)

# Alternatives:
- Buy the required tools and watch as they modify the barcode in front of you
- Ensure modifying your own barcode scanner is not illegal in Canada, because  if they know how to modify a barcode scanner, they proably know how to do other stuff
